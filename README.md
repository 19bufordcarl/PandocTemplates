My Pandoc Templates

After searching FOREVER and finally managing to get it work thorugh a bunch of github and stackoverflow threads, here is a template that makes pandoc export in obsidian work for *most* tables in a two column format export via latex to pdf.

If the tables have too many columns it'll break still. I give up on fixing it entirely. This is good enough for now. If you random internet user find a way to generalize this, please let me know. 

Add this to your Extra Pandoc Arguments in the obsidian plugin settings.
